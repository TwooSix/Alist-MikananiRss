Calls the backend ``/api/resolve_torrent`` endpoint, which downloads
the .torrent file (size- and time-bounded) and parses its metadata
with libtorrent.  Mirrors ``resolve_magnet``'s output so the assistant
can feed the result into the same downstream pipeline (library
duplicate check → user confirmation → create_download).
